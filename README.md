This is a website that offers services to people who want to lose weight and become more sporty and healthy. 
I collaborated with my groupmates, and we always supported each other, ensuring smooth operation.

My contributions to this site include:

   * Loader - visible during the site's loading process.
   * Header - made with links to various sections of the site.
   * Burger-menu - featuring links to all sections of the site, capable of opening and closing with a click (only for tablet and mobile versions).
     Includes social media buttons and a language switch.
   * "The results of my clients" Block: with clients' results and their photos. I made this block with Swiper.
   * Made page-404.
   * Made page-Developers.
   * Made an English version on the site.
   * Used plugin Perfect Pixel.
   * Favicon.

During my work on this project, I used HTML, CSS for typesetting (extensively employing Flexbox), JavaScript (for working with Burger-menu, Swiper, and Loader), Git repository, and PerfectPixel. 
I also utilized Figma for the layout and Trello as a task board. 
I implemented Bootstrap and Swiper@11 libraries, converted, and compressed all images for optimal website performance.

The layout of the blocks is adaptive, ranging from the mobile version to the desktop version, ensuring correct display on tablets and other devices with adaptive adjustments for images, buttons, and text.
